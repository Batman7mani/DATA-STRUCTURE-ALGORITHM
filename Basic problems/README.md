📘 Java Basic Problems Repository

Welcome to my Java Basics Repository 🚀
This repo contains solutions to fundamental coding problems, written in clean, beginner-friendly Java.
Each problem is solved with proper logic, efficient implementation, and correctness verification using test cases.

📝 Problems Included

The repository currently covers:

✅ Factorial of a Number

✅ GCD (Greatest Common Divisor)

✅ Prime Number Check

✅ Armstrong Number

✅ Neon Number

✅ Basic Matrix Operations (Multiplication, etc.)

✅ Number Reversal / Palindrome checks

✅ Patterns (Stars, Numbers, Alphabets)

🔹 More problems will be added continuously as I progress in my Java journey.

🔍 Features of My Code

📌 Correctness: Each program works for single test cases and covers edge cases (e.g., 0! = 1, GCD(a,0)=a).

⚡ Efficiency: Implemented using optimal time complexity approaches (no redundant computations).

🧹 Readability: Proper indentation, comments, and meaningful method names.

🏗 Reusability: Functions/methods structured for easy reuse in future programs.

🔎 Scalability: Handles a wide range of inputs within reasonable limits.

📊 Complexity Analysis
Overall

All problems are solved with optimal approaches →
⏳ Time Complexity: Mostly O(n) or better.
💾 Space Complexity: O(1) (constant extra memory).

Per Problem Breakdown
Problem	Time Complexity	Space Complexity	Remarks
Factorial	O(n)	O(1)	Iterative loop; efficient
GCD (Euclidean)	O(log(min(a,b)))	O(1)	Optimal GCD approach
Prime Check	O(√n)	O(1)	Checks divisors till √n
Armstrong Number	O(d)	O(1)	d = number of digits
Neon Number	O(log²n)	O(1)	Sum of digits of squared number
Number Reverse/Palindrome	O(d)	O(1)	Digit extraction
Matrix Multiplication	O(n³)	O(n²)	Standard matrix multiplication
Patterns (Stars/Numbers)	O(n²)	O(1)	Nested loops
